Hi there, my name is André Guimarães Sakata, and this is my personal blog. I mostly write about programming, project management, and product development. However, I may write about other random topics.

I'm a software developer from Brazil with more than 15 years of experience. You can find more details about my professional career on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andresakata/). Please, reach out to this channel if you want to contact me.

I used to write on [Medium](https://andresakata.medium.com/), but I intend to start writing here and then replicate some of my posts on other platforms. If you use this platform, follow me over there.
